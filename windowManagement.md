## Split screen bash
The `screen` function in `bash` makes it possible to split the screen. This can
be useful when working on clusters. See

http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/7453/how-to-split-the-terminal-into-more-than-one-view

## Invert colors
1. `sudo apt-get install xcalib`
2. Open `Keyboard Shortcuts`
3. Click on <kbd>Add</kbd>
4. Add a name
5. Enter `xcalib -i -a` in `Command`
6. Assign a shortcut, for example <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd>

## Hover mouse
Open `Window Preferences` -> `Behaviour` -> `Select windows when the mouse moves
over them`

## Maximize on double click
Open `Window Preferences` -> `Behaviour` -> `Titlebar action: Double-click
perform` -> `Maximize`

## Add workspaces
For Linux Mint 17, you can right click on an empty place in the taskbar/menu bar
(the bar where `Menu` is placed). Click on `Add to panel`->`Workspace
switcher`. Right click on the `Workspace switcher`-> `Preferences`.

## Compiz
Compiz is generally enhancing the windows, and is usually installed by default.
Take care when playing around with it though, as you can seriously break your
the graphics by choosing the wrong options.
