# Installing printer

## Linux Mint
1. Open "Printers"
2. Search for printers
3. Add (new printer)

This is usually enough to find a network printer, but be aware that this may take some time

Eventually:
1. Open "Printers"
2. Enter ip address in Enter URI: `socket://<ip>`
3. Port is usually `9100`
